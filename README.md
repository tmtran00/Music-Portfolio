# music-portfolio
Here is my project practicing fullstack web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS and SQLite in order display music that I have recently enjoyed. 
On this website, users are able to watch the music videos but clicking on collapsible button. This button is attached on to a YouTube Video which loads as the DOM object finished loading in.

At the bottom, I placed an API call onto last.fm radio station, I then received the top 5 most popular songs from a certain artist and and create a list to display them.
Each item on the list is a link to a search query on YouTube so that users can continue exploring.

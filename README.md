Here is my project practicing fullstack web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS and SQLite in order display music that I have recently enjoyed. 

On this website, I displayed various songs that I enjoyed listening to. Users can click on each songs which will drop down a YouTube video for the song.

At the bottom, I placed an API call onto last.fm radio station, I then received the top 5 most popular songs from a certain artist and and create a list to display them.
Each item on the list is a link to a search query on YouTube so that users can continue exploring.
